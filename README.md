## a INI file manipulation project\. VERY easy to use\!


</div>

### Description

Might not be very fitting for complexe ini manipulation, but this is the simplest and easy to use code i've found. Great for the newbie i am myself. It's not my code, and i don't know who it comes from, but i thought i'd share it. Included is a VERY easy to understand sample project !

Cheers, and enjoy :)
 
### More Info
 
You must unload the from right after you save the file, because i'f you try to reload right after, the new results don't show up, BUT they HAVE been saved to the ini file.
